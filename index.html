        <h1>intro:</h1><h5>   My ideas {writton in date: 2081/07/23 (november-8-2024)} </h5> 
    I heard that trovold made git in 5 days
    so it motivates me and I also wanna make similar tool
    so do u think is it possible(off curse it is)
    I wanna make It from scratch but it will be more similar than that tho
    

    also I am willing to use python for my simplicity I may optimized it with rust in upcoming future may be tho
    1st 1 will create a simple system, where
    let I am working in folder name
    I add some file in that file (like GIT add . or let say git add first)
    which will copy the file path of that first file
    and when I umm stag that change I mean like (git commit )
    I will simply just copy all files in that folder (including both new and old files)
    and if I wanna revert like seeing commit history
    like if I wanna code that don't had that first file
    the system will remember the last git add (file path) and git commit(copy of folder)
    than serve me by removing first file
    this will be my 1st goal (I know it's not efficient, and 
    at 1st I don't wanna make it efficient like git  it cause I am not
    Linus I am aakku)


    I will create 3 lvl or stages to create my version control tool ("ccn") initial setup
    like:
    1-> creating a logic for coping entire folder
    2-> logic to store the file path of given file
    3-> comping 1 and 2 this will make a system which will make a copy of folder keeping track of changed file
    4-> keeping that system in something like a stack like system
    5-> logic to remove that last stag and serve n-1 from stack
    
    well that makes it 5ðŸ˜… well who cares I am not good in mathaðŸ˜š

        <h5>1st stage</h5>
            <p> 
                i created a simple logic to copy the entire folder <a href="./copyfile.py/getFolder.py">here the actual code for it</a>
                <progress value="1" max="5"></progress>
            </p>
            <h5>2nd stage</h5>
                <p> 
                    i created a simple logic to show the file name  in given folder 

                    and  show the name of files in that folder <a href="./copyfile.py/getFolder.py">here the actual code for it</a>

                    <progress value="1.5" max="5"></progress>
